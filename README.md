# CH5650-Assignment

The objective of this assignment is to predict the radius of gyration of a polymer which a sequence of styrene and stearate monomers. The data set contained 3030 sequences in which the two monomers are represented by the numbers '1' and '2', and the computed radius of gyration for each sequence. The code is given in [model.ipynb](https://github.com/AyeshaUlde/CH5650-Assignment/blob/main/model.ipynb) and the results are reported in [CH5650_Assignment.pdf](https://github.com/AyeshaUlde/CH5650-Assignment/blob/main/CH5650_Assignment.pdf).
